# PineappleEA-GUI
A simple tool to download and update early access builds of yuzu from the [PineappleEA](https://github.com/pineappleEA/pineapple-src "PineappleEA") Github repo. This tool is currently quite basic, but does support updating with overwrites of previous versions, saved location handling and lets you install backwards of up to 10 versions.
Note, Requires GTK runtime if you don't have it already:
Windows: https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer)
Linux: Distro-dependent but should be included in your distros mono package. Or you can download it by itself e.g libgtk-3-0 on debian or gtk3 for Arch.
